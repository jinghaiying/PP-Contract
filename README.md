PPO Chain -- practical value public chain



PPO applied value public chain is an all-domain applied public chain based on the Internet of things thinking, with blockchain, big data, AI, SDK, Internet and other technical structures, and aiming at the Internet of everything and the integration of computing power. PPO can break the barriers between industries, cross the technical gap, and build a bridge of the Internet of everything.



For example, in the field of mining machine computing power, embedded PPO public chain can realize the integration of scattered mining machines and distributed mines, so that the computing power will produce aggregation effect, the appearance of 1+ 1&GT; 2 effect, computing power will truly realize the leap from quantitative change to qualitative change. In the field of digital transactions, PPO public chain can provide complete AI and SDK ecology, completely get rid of the dependence on intelligent contract, and any traditional language can access the public chain, truly realizing decentralization. In the field of physical interconnection, the embedded PPO public chain can promote the development of artificial intelligence. All network equipment and electrical equipment can be connected in series through the PPO value public chain and connected to the artificial intelligence neural network, so as to truly realize the Internet of everything and control it at will.



The applied value public chain of PPO has multiple, powerful and rich application scenarios, which can quickly promote the innovation and reform of human face recognition, computing force integration, physical card, artificial intelligence, sharing economy and other industrial technologies, provide a strong driving force for social development, generate unlimited business opportunities in the industry reform, and create boundless wealth for public investors.
